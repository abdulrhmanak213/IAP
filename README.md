# Web Applications

## IAP (Internet Applications Project)

This project is part of the Web Applications course for the Information Technology Engineering Department - Fifth Year - Software Engineering and Information Systems specialization.

The project is a website that allows users to upload files in various formats and organize them into groups. It includes several features such as:

1. Locking and editing files (with the ability to specify a group of files for locking or editing).
2. Sharing files with users at the site level or adding them to a group of files.
3. Tracking the status of files and the modifications made to them since their creation.

## Non-functional Requirements

1. Implementing load balancing between two instances of the system.
2. System-level logging to record all incoming requests and outgoing responses.
3. Applying load testing on the system using Apache JMeter.
